# Edit Docket Feature - Implementation Summary
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Tested

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive Edit Docket functionality allowing correction of weighbridge delivery dockets with full audit trail and stock reconciliation.

## Business Context
Weighbridge dockets should rarely be edited, but when human errors occur (wrong product selected, incorrect location, etc.), the system needs a way to correct them while maintaining complete audit trails for compliance.

## Implementation Approach

### Two-Phase Edit Process
When a docket is edited, the system creates **TWO audit records**:

1. **REVERSAL Movement** (Type: EDIT)
   - Returns stock to the ORIGINAL location
   - Uses ORIGINAL product
   - Positive quantity (adding stock back)
   - Reference: "REVERSAL of [docket_number]"

2. **CORRECTION Movement** (Type: EDIT)
   - Takes stock from the CORRECTED location
   - Uses CORRECTED product
   - Negative quantity (removing stock)
   - Contains all corrected values

3. **Update Original Docket**
   - Original docket record updated with corrected values
   - Maintains same docket number
   - Adds: `edited_at`, `edited_by`, `edit_reason`

### Stock Reconciliation
- Weighted average costing maintained
- Stock availability validated before correction
- Prevents negative stock scenarios
- Both movements update `current_stock` table

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`public/edit-docket.html`**
   - Edit form with read-only weight fields
   - Product/location/customer dropdowns
   - Edit reason (required) and notes
   - Confirmation modal with comparison table

2. **`public/js/edit-docket.js`**
   - Loads docket data via API
   - Populates form with original values
   - Dynamic location filtering by product stock
   - Builds comparison table showing changes
   - Submits edit with validation

3. **`server/routes/docket-edit.js`**
   - POST `/api/dockets/edit` endpoint
   - Transaction-based processing
   - Stock validation and reconciliation
   - Complete error handling with rollback

### Modified Files
1. **`public/weighbridge-delivery-docket.html`**
   - Added Edit button (hidden until docket loads)
   - Fixed page width to match other pages (1400px)
   - Added `editDocket()` function
   - Edit button visibility controlled by `showDocket()`

2. **`server/server.js`**
   - Registered `/api/dockets` route
   - Added console log for edit endpoint

3. **`server/routes/weighbridge-docket-api.js`**
   - Fixed carrier display (was showing customer_name)
   - Added carrier LEFT JOIN

4. **`server/routes/movements.js`**
   - Fixed NaN in docket number generation
   - Added LIKE 'DN%' filter to exclude EDIT movements

## Database Changes

### Columns Added to `stock_movements`
```sql
ALTER TABLE stock_movements 
ADD COLUMN edited_at TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN edited_by VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN edit_reason TEXT,
ADD COLUMN original_docket_number VARCHAR(50);
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Weight Fields Protected
- Gross, Tare, and Net weights are READ-ONLY
- Cannot be modified (business rule: weights are from weighbridge)

### ✅ Product Change Validation
- Location dropdown filters by product stock availability
- Shows available quantities
- Prevents selecting locations without stock

### ✅ Confirmation with Comparison
- Side-by-side comparison of original vs corrected values
- Highlights changed fields in yellow
- Clear explanation of what will happen

### ✅ Complete Audit Trail
- Two EDIT movements visible in Operations page
- Original docket shows corrected values
- `edit_reason` stored for compliance
- `original_docket_number` links corrections to source

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Edit button appears after loading docket
- [x] Form pre-populates with original values
- [x] Product change updates location dropdown
- [x] Confirmation modal shows comparison
- [x] Two EDIT movements created correctly
- [x] Stock balances adjusted properly
- [x] Original docket updated
- [x] Page widths consistent across system

## Known Limitations

1. **Weights Cannot Be Edited**
   - Design decision: weighbridge data is considered authoritative
   - Would require different approach if needed

2. **Cannot Undo Edits**
   - Once confirmed, edit is permanent
   - Would need separate "Reverse Edit" feature

3. **Edit Reason Required**
   - Business rule for audit compliance
   - Cannot be bypassed

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **User Authentication**
   - Currently uses `edited_by = 'system'`
   - Should capture actual logged-in user

2. **Edit History View**
   - Show all edits for a specific docket
   - Timeline of changes

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Alert manager when dockets are edited
   - Weekly summary of all edits

4. **Account Detail Report Integration**
   - Show edited status on reports
   - Include edit reason in hover/tooltip

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/dockets/edit`
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "original_docket_number": "DN00001",
  "product_id": 33,
  "from_location_id": 17,
  "customer_id": 1,
  "unit_price": 69.00,
  "vehicle_id": 2,
  "driver_id": 1,
  "carrier_id": 1,
  "delivery_id": 1,
  "reference_number": "PO444555666",
  "notes": "Test notes",
  "edit_reason": "Wrong product selected"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Docket edited successfully",
  "reversal_movement_id": 130,
  "correction_movement_id": 131
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Import Fix
Initial deployment failed with:
```
TypeError: pool.connect is not a function
```

**Fix:** Changed from `const pool = require(...)` to `const { pool } = require(...)`

### Page Width Consistency
WBD page was using full width. Fixed by:
- Adding `.page-container` wrapper
- Setting `max-width: 1400px`
- Matching Dashboard/Operations/Maintenance layout

## Lessons Learned

1. **Two-phase approach works well** for maintaining audit trails
2. **Stock validation is critical** to prevent negative stock
3. **Comparison modal** greatly improves user confidence
4. **Transaction-based DB operations** essential for data integrity
5. **Consistent page widths** improve UX across system
